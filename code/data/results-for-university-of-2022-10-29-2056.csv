It has created a huge barrier and is an example of how gross stupidly increases the workload for researchers. Very poor with respect to our research culture. Anothe example is the imposition of Diversity Travel as our sole Travel Agency - limiting choice to a single supplier stifles competition and consequently we pay more from our hard won grants to travel to conferences.

The enforced use of Diversity Travel (laughable name given we have no choice) as our sole supplier is another example of institutional bullying and poor consultation with grant holders in our research community.
